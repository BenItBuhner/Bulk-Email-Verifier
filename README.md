# Bulk-Email-Verifier

### Setting Up the Bulk Email Verification Script

#### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). It's recommended to use Python 3.6 or higher.

#### 2. Install Required Packages

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required packages:

```sh
pip install dnspython tqdm
```

#### 3. Directory Structure

Create a directory for your project and ensure it has the following structure:

```
email_verification/
|-- emails.csv
|-- spam-domains.txt
|-- MX_Records.csv
|-- email_verification.py
```

- `emails.csv`: This file should contain the list of emails to verify, with a header `Email`.
- `spam-domains.txt`: This file should contain the list of spam domains, each on a new line.
- `MX_Records.csv`: This file will store cached MX records. You don't need to create it initially; it will be generated by the script.
- `email_verification.py`: This is your main script file.

#### 4. Script Content

Copy the provided Python script into `email_verification.py`.

### Using the Script

#### 1. Preparing `emails.csv`

Ensure `emails.csv` contains the email addresses you want to verify. The file should be in the following format:

```
Email
user1@example.com
user2@example.com
...
```

#### 2. Preparing `spam-domains.txt`

Add any known spam or phishy domains to `spam-domains.txt`, each on a new line. Example:

```
spamdomain.com
phishingsite.org
malicious.co
```

#### 3. Running the Script

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your script, and run:

```sh
python email_verification.py
```

The script will process the emails, verify them, and generate output files.

### Script Output

After running the script, the following files will be generated in the `Exports` directory:

- `valid_emails.csv`: Contains emails that are valid.
- `invalid_emails.csv`: Contains emails that are invalid.
- `spam_trap_emails.csv`: Contains emails identified as spam traps.
- `business_emails.csv`: Contains emails identified as business emails.
- `all_emails.csv`: Contains detailed results for all processed emails.

### Configurations

You can modify the following configurations in the script:

- **EMAIL**: The email address used for SMTP verification.
- **PASSWORD**: The password for the above email (if needed for SMTP authentication).
- **PORT**: The port used for SMTP (default is 25).
- **THREAD_COUNT**: The number of threads for concurrent processing (default is 175).
- **SERVER_TIMEOUT**: The timeout for server connections (default is 12 seconds).
- **REFRESH_MX_RECORDS**: Set to `True` to refresh MX records, or `False` to use cached records.
- **AOL_YAHOO_POLICY**: Set to either `valid` or `invalid` to treat AOL and Yahoo emails accordingly.

### Maintaining the Script

#### 1. Updating `spam-domains.txt`

Regularly update `spam-domains.txt` with new spam domains as they are identified to keep your verification process up-to-date.

#### 2. Managing `MX_Records.csv`

- **Clearing Cache**: If you suspect that the cached MX records are outdated or incorrect, delete `MX_Records.csv` or set `REFRESH_MX_RECORDS` to `True` to refresh the records.
- **Optimizing Cache**: If you often verify the same domains, keeping `REFRESH_MX_RECORDS` set to `False` will speed up the process by using cached MX records.

#### 3. Monitoring Logs

The script generates logs in `email_verification.log`. Regularly monitor this log file for errors and performance issues.

#### 4. Dependencies

Keep your dependencies updated. Periodically run:

```sh
pip install --upgrade dnspython tqdm
```

If you encounter any issues, refer to the log file for troubleshooting, and ensure your input files are correctly formatted.
